# Building a RSS file from YAML

- Use a python script to convert YAML into RSS file.
- Ensure Podcast requirements are met as per https://podcasters.apple.com/support/823-podcast-requirements
- Setup GitHub Actions to ensure the RSS feed is updated every time the YAML file is checked in. i.e. the Python script to convert the YAML to XML is executed, and the code is published to master
